## 🔍 Overview

These notes were created based on a Real Analysis course at Ocean University of China. The content is designed for a 3-hour weekly course format and provides in-depth coverage of real analysis concepts. Please note that due to its specialized organization, these materials are not recommended for first-time learners of the subject. Also, to make the structure of real analysis much better, some part of materials that are not in the course would be put in.

## 📑 Document Structure

### Covering Topics

The notes are organized into the following chapters:

1. **Fundemantal Set Theory** - Foundational concepts and theorems in set theory
2. **Lebesgue Measure** - Introduction to measure theory and Lebesgue measure
3. **Measurable Functions** - Properties and operations of measurable functions
4. **Lebesgue Integration** - Theory and applications of Lebesgue integration
